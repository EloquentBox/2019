/* Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog's age can be 
calculated in "dog years" to account for their growth compared to a human of
 the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs â€” 8 years
  in a human's life equates to 45 years in a dog's life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

Here's how you convert your age from "human years" to "dog years":

The first two years of a dog's life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care of it! 
With your knowledge of math operators and variables, use JavaScript to convert 
your human age into dog years.

// How old I am

let myAge = 321; 

// In first two years count as 10.5 dog years each

let earlyYears = 2; 

earlyYears *= 10.5;

// Subrtract firsst two years from my age.

let laterYears = myAge - earlyYears; 

// Multiply rest of years times 4 to count how old is dog in his measure.

laterYears *= 4;

// Just check

console.log(earlyYears, laterYears);

// Add both numbers

let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

//My name (with String)

let myName = 'Karol'.toLowerCase();

console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
